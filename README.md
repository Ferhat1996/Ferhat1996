# Hi, I'm Ferhat ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Economics at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich. My academic focus is on data analytics, modeling, and applied econometrics. I love using data to uncover insights, and I'm passionate about building models that solve real-world problems.

## What I Do

- **Data Analysis:** I enjoy exploring datasets, finding patterns, and drawing meaningful conclusions.
- **Modeling:** Whether it's regression analysis, time series, or machine learning models, I'm into it all.
- **Applied Econometrics:** I apply statistical methods to economic data to test hypotheses and make predictions.
